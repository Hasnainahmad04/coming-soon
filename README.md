## 2. API Integration

I have integrated a dummy API for demonstration purposes, utilizing [Dummy JSON](https://dummyjson.com/docs/posts). The implementation also includes server-side pagination for efficient data handling and display.

### Features:

- **Dummy API Integration:** Fetching data from a mock API to simulate real-world scenarios.
- **Server-Side Pagination:** Efficiently handles large datasets by fetching and displaying data in chunks.
